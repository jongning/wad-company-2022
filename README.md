The item and price are the data that is retrieved from the products collection. The user selects a drop down item and the price is generated automatically from the database. The user simply needs to enter a quantity and click save, and the data is saved in the quote collection in MongoDB.
-The third tab is the product management page, which is linked to the product collection and allows for the addition, editing, and deletion of new products.
-The last page is the quote management, which displays a list of items that have been saved in the quotation collection. It appears in a table with the date, item name, quantity, price, amount, and total amount of all items. The item is ordered by the date entered. Furthermore, if the user wants to add more quotations, they may do so by clicking on the create quote button, which will take them to the create-quotation page.
